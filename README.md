## **üåà Our Inspirational Journey:**
When we embarked on this exciting partnership with Fannie Mae, we were filled with enthusiasm to tackle their challenge and leverage their invaluable data. We brainstormed, collaborated, and brought to life innovative solutions to address the significant issue of loan approvals.

## **üöÄ What It Does:**
Our state-of-the-art web platform is your gateway to homeownership. Using Fannie Mae's metrics, we determine your loan eligibility. If you're approved, you'll explore a dynamic map showcasing available homes and gain direct access to Fannie Mae's resources. For those not approved, our platform offers personalized advice, supported by an AI-powered chatbot.

Our talented team harnessed the power of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind to craft a visually captivating web front-end. For the robust backend, we developed an API using FastAPI, hosted on Google Cloud, which leverages a finely tuned PaLM model to evaluate applicants. We've integrated Google Maps and the Zillow API to enhance the housing search.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Challenges We Overcame:**
We faced our fair share of challenges. Integrating FastAPI with our front-end presented hurdles, but our determination led to a successful connection. While working with Zillow data, we encountered obstacles that we turned into opportunities by extracting additional valuable information to better assist users. Managing various operating systems added complexity, but our teamwork and communication skills prevailed.

## **üèÜ Our Proud Achievements:**
Our proudest moment was seamlessly bridging the gap between front-end and back-end systems. We successfully harnessed the full potential of the Google Cloud Platform, enriching our project with powerful tools.

## **üß† What We Learned:**
Beyond technical skills, this journey provided deep insights into the complexities of lending. Collaborating with Fannie Mae granted us an understanding of the intricacies of the lending process. We further honed our expertise in JavaScript, Flask, and Google Cloud.

## **üöÄ What's Next for Move Out With US:**
Our commitment to empowering homebuyers continues. We're dedicated to delivering even more personalized solutions for securing home loans. Our vision extends to expanding our services to encompass credit card payments, car loans, student loans, and more, all aimed at simplifying the path to homeownership. üå†
